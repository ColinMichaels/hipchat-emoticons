## Creating your own emoticons

We are using HipChat's built-in emoticon feature, which means an admin must upload the image in order for it to work. However, you can still create a pull request to get your icon into the repo, then let a HipChat admin know.

* Max dimensions are 25px tall and 30px wide
* Use a transparent PNG or animated GIF for best results
* Images must be under 100Kb
